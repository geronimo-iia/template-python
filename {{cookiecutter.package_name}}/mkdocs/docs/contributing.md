This project is based on [Geronimo-iaa's Python Template](https://github.com/geronimo-iia/template-python).
This is a cookiecutter template for a typical Python library following modern packaging conventions. It utilizes popular libraries alongside Make and Graphviz to fully automate all development and deployment tasks.

## Setup

### Requirements

* Make:
    * macOS: `$ xcode-select --install`
    * Linux: [https://www.gnu.org/software/make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make)
    * Windows: [https://mingw.org/download/installer](https://mingw.org/download/installer)
* Pyenv: [https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation)
* Python: `$ pyenv install 3.7.3`

  Note for [MacOS 10.14 user](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/544):
  ```bash
    SDKROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.14 pyenv install 3.7.3
  ```
* Poetry: [https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/#installation](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/#installation)

  Note:
  ```bash
  poetry config settings.virtualenvs.path "${HOME}/.virtualenvs"
  ```
* Graphviz:
    * macOS: `$ brew install graphviz`
    * Linux: [https://graphviz.org/download](https://graphviz.org/download/)
    * Windows: [https://graphviz.org/download](https://graphviz.org/download/)

To confirm these system dependencies are configured correctly:

```text
$ make doctor
```

### Installation

```text
$ make install
```

## Development Tasks

### Manual

```text
$ make test
```

Run static analysis:

```text
$ make check
```
